# hyperbolicSpaceTool_extended
This is an Extention of the hyperbolicspacetool made by Arndt(https://github.com/JpXionix/PoincareDisk). In here the visualisation is extended by 2 other visualisations.


This tool implements a visualisation of the hyperbolic Space.
The visualisation of the Poincaré Disk is made and implemented mostly as in https://github.com/JpXionix/PoincareDisk.

The visualisation of the Beltrami-Klein Disk has two functionalities:
Changing its orientation(circling arrow icon) and moving the widget(blank icon)

The visualisation of the Poincaré plane has the same functions as the Beltrami-Klein disk, with the addition of:
Moving the window of the plane with the corresponding arrow icons.
Zooming in and out with the + and - icons.
Switching between visualisation with the axis and/or grid shown. With the correspondingly labeled icons.
In addition, if the axis are switched on, the coordinates can also be switched on or off with the Coor icon.

All changes made on the Poincaré disk are reflected on the Poincaré planes and beltrami-Klein disks.
